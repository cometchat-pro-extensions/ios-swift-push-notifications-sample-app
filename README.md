# Add Push Notification inside your project
   
   1. Add CometChat SDK.
   
   We recommend using CocoaPods, as they are the most advanced way of managing iOS project dependencies. Open a terminal   window, move to your project directory, and then update the SDK  by running the following command.
   
   ```
   $ pod install
   ```
   
   If the pod installation fails due to Cocoapods dependancy issue then use the below command to install the framework through cocoapods.
  
  ```
   pod install --repo-update
   ```
   2. We are providing two ways to implement push notification for your app. 
   
   1. [Firebase](https://prodocs.cometchat.com/docs/ios-extensions-enhanced-push-notification)
   2. [APNS (Supports Callkit)](https://prodocs.cometchat.com/docs/ios-extensions-enhanced-push-notification-apns)
   
   Please refer our documentation to intergrate push notification inside your app.
   
   ### Note: 
   
   1. Ignore firebase setup if you're using APNS based approach. 
   2. Please add Callkit related code carefully to avoid issues.
